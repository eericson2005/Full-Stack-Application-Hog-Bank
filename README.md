## Description
In this project, I lead a team of five data scientists as we investigated the location of public toilets in Australia. We conducted this research with the aim of understanding how people’s basic hygiene needs were being met by public infrastructure across the country. We measured this quality across five dimensions:
-	Gender
-	Travel
-	Accessibility to people with disabilities
-	Pollution
-	Disease
I assumed responsibility for tracking the availability of public toilets to travelers along Australia’s major roads and illustrated my results through Tableau.

This project was a very valuable experience that allowed me to experiment with the power of Tableau. While designing my visualizations, I learned how to create calculated fields, parameters, dashboards, and stories. I also utilized pre-attentive attributes and Gestalt principles to capture an audience’s attention, communicating the results of my analysis clearly and succinctly.

The visualization I designed allows the user to input a parameter, either All, Shower, Parking, or Dump Point, that will dynamically filter the map of Australia and its roads to either show all toilets or show toilets that have the selected amenity. This functionality enables the user to first get an overview of where the toilets are in relation to Australia’s major roads and then drill down into the availability of more specific hygiene infrastructure that would be important for those traveling on the road. 

Included in the README are links to my Tableau Public page, where you can find the visualization I made for this project along with all other visualizations I’ve worked on, our team PowerPoint, and a written portfolio that includes an infographic, press release, memo, abstract, executive summary, and a technical report to communicate our findings. 

If any of the links in the README don’t work, please email me at ericson@uark.edu and I’ll adjust the permissions for the documents. The University of Arkansas will unfortunately not allow me to indefinitely share my documents publicly through the student OneDrive. Alternatively, you can download the raw file directly.
