## Description
In this project, I worked with a team of five data scientists to create a full stack internal banking app to be used by employees at a fictional financial institution called Hog Bank. Our main goals with this project were:
- Develop a functioning SQL Server Management Studio database
- Design a front end winform for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
I assumed responsibility for creating the front end winform using C# and Visual Studio.

This project was a very valuable experience that allowed me to experiment with front end development, which as a data scientist, I had not had much experience with. While designing the website, I learned how to leverage pre-attentive attributes to direct user attention to important areas. Getting exposure to C# was also an added bonus.

To view the front end I created, follow these steps:
1. Unzip Foxtrot_WinForm_source_only.zip.
2. Open Visual Studio.
3. File → Open → Project/Solution → select Group Project Front End.sln.
4. Press F5 (Start Debugging) or click Run.

Included in the README are links to our Data Dictionary (based on ficticious financial data), our Entity Relationship Diagram, the SQL Queries we use to grab data from our database, the front end winform code, a User Manual for navigating our website, and finally our PowerPoint presentation. 

If any of the links in the README don’t work, please email me at ericson@uark.edu and I’ll adjust the permissions for the documents. The University of Arkansas will unfortunately not allow me to indefinitely share my documents publicly through the student OneDrive. Alternatively, you can download the raw file directly.
